 Derivation for Expression for normality of solution in physical chemistry with relation to gram per litre
---

- $$ \text{Normality} = \frac{\text{Number of gram equivalent of solute}}{\text{Volume of solution in litre}} $$ 
- $$ \text{Normality} = \frac{\frac{\text{Weight in gram}}{\text{Equivalent weight}}}{\text{Volume of solution in litre}} $$ 
- $$ \text{Normality} = \frac{\text{Weight of solute in gram}}{\text{Weight of solution in litre}} \times \frac{1}{\text{Equivalent weight}} $$ 
- $$ \text{Normality \times Equivalent Weight} = \frac{Weight of solute in gram }{Volume of solution in litre} $$ 
- $$ \text{gmL}^{-1} = \text{Normality} \times \text{Equivalent Weight} $$
