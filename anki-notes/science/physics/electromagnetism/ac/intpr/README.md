Constant current whose magnitude of flow of charge equals that of alternating current

- Constant current
- At identical circuit
- At same time
- Whose magnitude of flow of charge
- Equals alternating current

Mean value in alternating current is that constant current flowing at a circuit whose magnitude of flow of charge is equal to the magnitude of flow of charge of an alternating current flowing at the same identical circuit at the same time. The illustration is done by taking two identical circuits. These identical circuits have same parameters of electrical factors like resistance , uniformity of cross section of wires in the circuit. 

The observations are made at the same time period. The current across the circuits are flown. A direct current in one of the circuit and alternating on the another. The magnitude of flow of charge is measured at both the circuits. At a particular instance of time , both the circuits have the same amount of charge flowing through them. At that time, current on the direct circuit can be measured as it is constant whilst that on the alternating can't be measured.

Referring to the direct current at that time based on the similarity of flow of charge the mean value of alternating current is assumed to be the value of direct current at that instance.
