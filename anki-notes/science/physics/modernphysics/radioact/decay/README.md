- $$ \frac{dN}{dt} \alpha N $$ 
- $$ \frac{dN}{N} = -\lambda dt $$ 
- $$ \int_{N_{0}}^{N} \frac{dN}{N} = - \lambda \int_{0}^{t} dt $$ 
- $$ \log_{e}(N) - \log_{e}(N_{0}) = \lambda t $$ 
- $$ \log_{e}( \frac{N}{N_{0}} ) = - \lambda t $$ 
- $$ \frac{N}{N_{0}} = e^{- \lambda t} $$ 
- $$ N = N_{0}e^{- \lambda t} $$
