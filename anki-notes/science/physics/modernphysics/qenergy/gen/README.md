Calculation of wavelength
=========================

-   The **wavelength** of lyman series is calculated using:
    $$\frac{1}{\lambda} = R (\frac{1}{1^2}-\frac{1}{n^2})$$

    -   $R$ is Rydberg *constant* .

    -   $n$ is the value of orbit.

Excitation Energy
=================

Definition
----------

-   The **excitation** energy is the amount of energy required to raise
    and electron from it’s ground state to the corresponding excited
    *state* .

-   The *first* excited state’s excitation energy is the amount of
    energy required to raise the electron form ground state $n=1$ to the
    **first** excited state $n=2$ .
    $$E = E_2 - E_1 = -3.4 eV -(-13.6 eV) = 10.2eV$$

Excitation Potential
====================

Definition
----------

-   The **excitation** potential is the amount of potential difference
    required to accelerate the electron from the ground state to the
    *corresponding* excited state.

-   The *first* excitation potential is the amount of potential
    difference required to accelerate the electron from the *ground*
    state to the first *excited* state.

$$\frac{E_2-E_1}{e} = \frac{-3.4eV-(-13.6eV)}{e} = 10.2V$$

Ionization Energy
=================

-   **Ionization Energy** is the amount of energy required to move an
    electron from it’s **ground state** to **completely** *out* of the
    atom. $$E = {E_{\infty}-E_{1}} = 0 - (-13.6eV) = 13.6eV$$

Ionization Potential
====================

-   **Ionization Potential** is the amount of **potential difference**
    required to *accelerate* and electron from it’s *ground state* to
    *completely out of the* **atom** .
    $$V = \frac{E_{\infty}-E_{1}}{e}= \frac{0 - (-13.6eV)}{e} = 13.6V$$

Limitation of Bohr’s Atomic Model
=================================

-   **Bohr’s atomic model** could not explain spectral lines of:

    -   **multi** electron systems other than **hydrogen** and
        **hydrogen like** atoms.

-   **Bohr’s** atomic model doesnot clarify the **circular** structure
    of orbit of electron.

-   **Zeeman Effect:**

    -   **Zeeman Effect** is the splitting of spectral lines in
        **magnetic field** .

    -   Bohr’s model couldnot explain it.

-   **Stark Effect:**

    -   **Stark Effect** is the splitting of spectral lines in
        **electric field** .

    -   Bohr’s model couldnot explain it.

-   Bohr’s model couldnot explain the **wave like** character of
    **electron** .

-   It doesnot explain the **relative** *splitting* of spectral lines.

De Broglie Hypothesis
=====================

-   **Statement:** Luis Debroglie states that:

    -   A moving particle has both **wave like** and **particle like**
        characters.

    -   A moving particle is associated with **waves.**

-   These waves are called:

    -   Debroglie Waves

    -   Matter Waves

-   The **wavelength** $\lambda$ of **matter waves** can be expressed as
    the same way for photon. $$\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$$

Calculation of wavelength of an electron
----------------------------------------

-   mass = $m$

-   potential difference for acceleration = $V$

-   velocity of electron = $v$

-   momentum of electron = $p$

-   charge of electron = $e$

-   wavelength = $\lambda$

$$\begin{aligned}
          \lambda &= \frac{h}{p} \\
          eV &= \frac{1}{2} mv^2 \\
          v &= \sqrt{\frac{2eV}{m}} \\
          \lambda &= \frac{h}{m \sqrt{\frac{2eV}{m}}} \\
          \lambda &= \frac{h}{\sqrt{2meV}} 
        \end{aligned}$$

-   The equation for expressing wavelength of **electron** is:
    $$\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2meV}}$$

Heisenberg’s uncertainity Principle
===================================

Canonically conjugate variables
-------------------------------

-   **Canonically conjugate** variables are:

    -   pair of *physical* **variables**

    -   those which can *describe* the motion of a system.

-   Examples of **cannonically** conjugate variables are:

    -   **Momentum** and **Position**

    -   **Energy** and **Time**

    -   **Angular Momentum** and **Angular Position**

Statement
---------

-   **Heisenberg’s** uncertainty principle states that:

    -   The pair of *physical* variables *describing* the motion of an
        **atomic system** cannot be measured **precisely** and
        **simultaneously**.

Mathematical Interpretation
---------------------------

-   The interpretation of **canonically paired** physical variables are:

$$\triangle x \triangle p \geq \frac{h}{2 \pi}$$
$$\triangle E \triangle t \geq \frac{h}{2\pi}$$
$$\triangle \theta \triangle L \geq \frac{h}{2\pi}$$

Application of Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle
-------------------------------------------------

-   **Heisenberg’s uncertainty** principle is used to prove that the
    **electron** cannot exist inside the **nucleus** .

<!-- -->

-   mass of electron = $m$

-   planck’s constant = $h$

-   change in position = $\triangle x$

-   $\triangle x$ = magnitude of radius of nucleus

-   $\triangle x$ = $10^{-14} m$

-   change in momentum = $\triangle p$ $$\begin{aligned}
              \triangle x \triangle p &\geq \frac{h}{2\pi}\\
              \triangle p &= \frac{h}{2\pi \triangle x} \\
              \triangle v_{x} &= \frac{h}{2\pi \triangle x m} \\
              \triangle v_{x} &= \frac{6.62 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 3.14 \times 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \times 10^{-14}} \\
              \triangle v_{x} &= 1.16 \times 10^{10} m/s
            \end{aligned}$$

<!-- -->

-   This magnitude of velocity is *unattainable* .

-   The speed limit in the universe is $3 \times 10^{8} m/s$.
