 Proof for expression of binomial theorem in terms of induction

- $$ (a + x)^{n} = (a+x) ( a +x  ) . . \text{ to n factors } $$
- Take a from n factors each.
- Take a from n - 1 factors each.  Take x from remaining one.
- Take a from n - r factors each. Take x from r factors.
- Vary r from 0 to n.
- Express by C(n,r)
