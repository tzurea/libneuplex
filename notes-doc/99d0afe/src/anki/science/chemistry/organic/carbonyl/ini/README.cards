$$
\text{Name of Aldehyde} = \text{ Alkyl - {ic/oc} acid } + \text{aldehyde}
$$ 


- The common name of aldehydes is structured in relation with their preparation. The parent of common name of aldehyde is of that acid which the aldehyde gives on oxidation. Formaldehyde on oxidation yields formic acid.
