Wrought Iron
============

-   Wrought Iron is the purest form of iron.

-   Wrought Iron contains some amount of impurities.

    -   Carbon C = 0.12 to 0.25%

-   The other impurities that contain in trace amount are:

    -   S

    -   Mn

    -   Si

    -   P

Formation of Wrought Iron
-------------------------

-   Pig iron is made into wrought iron.

-   This is done by removing impurities from pig iron.

-   The impurities are removed by using oxidizing agents.

-   An example that removes impurities from carbon is:

    -   

The chemical equation expressing the oxidation of carbon from pig iron
is:

-   

-   The only carbon product in the product is CO.

-   Ultimately CO evolves as a gas.

### Properties of Wrought Iron

The major properties of wrought iron are contributed by the fact that
the amount of carbon present in wrought iron is very less.

-   Wrought iron is less hard compared to other forms of iron such as
    pig iron.

    -   This compensation in hardness is brought about by the missing of
        iron carbide.

    -   This also imposes an implication of property of less brittleness
        in wrought iron.

-   Wrought iron is also called **soft iron**.

-   Melting point M.P. of wrought iron is: 1500^{}

-   Wrought iron gets rusted easily.

### Uses of wrought iron

Wrought iron is used for the following purposes.

-   Wrought iron is used to make magnet and dynamos.

-   Wrought iron is used to make knots and bolts of vehicles , bicycles.

-   Wrought iron is used in making chains of vehicles.

-   Wrought iron has use in making electric wires.

iron 2%-5% - wrought iron 0.12%-0.25%

The carbon content in steel is between : - 0.25 % - 2 %

Heat Treatment of Steel
=======================

Heat treatment of steel is the phenomenon of heating or cooling steel
under certain conditions to customize the physical properties of the
steel without altering any change in chemical composition.

Heat steel generally is:

-   phenomenon

-   where heating or cooling is done

-   there is the presence of condition

The purpose of heat treatment of steel is:

-   to customize the physical property of the steel to one’s need
    without altering chemical composition.

The properties that heat treatment of steel acts on are:

-   hardness

-   malleability

-   ductility

The application of heat treatment of steel are:

-   Heat treatment removes internal trapped gas present at the steel.

-   Heat treatment of steel increase the hardness of the steel.

### Types of Heat Treatment of Steel

The types of heat treatment of steel are: - quenching - anneleaing -
tempering

### Quenching

-   **Objective of quenching:**

-   The hardness of the steel increases form quenching.

-   **Reason for increased harness for steel.**

-   The reason for increased hardness of steel is due to the presence of
    cementite.

-   Cementite is iron carbide.

-   The molecular formula for cementite is

### Method of quenching

The process of quenching is done in the following way:

-   The steel is heated to redness initially.

-   The steel is suddenly plunged into solvent.

-   The solvent may be water or oil.

### Change in properties after heat treatment of steel

-   Steel becomes more harder.

-   Steel becomes more brittle.

-   The elasticity of steel decreases.
