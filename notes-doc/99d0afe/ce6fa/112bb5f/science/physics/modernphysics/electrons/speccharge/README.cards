 Derivation for expression of calculation of charge to mass ratio of  JJ Thomson's experiment of determination of specific charge 
---


- $$ eV = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}  $$ 
- $$ \frac{e}{m} = \frac{v^{2}}{2V} $$ 
- $$ Bev = eE $$ 
- $$ v = \frac{E}{B} $$ 
- $$ \frac{e}{m} = \frac{E^{2}}{2B^{2}V} $$ 
- $$ \frac{e}{m} = \frac{V_{1}^{2}}{2Vd^{2}B^{2}} $$
