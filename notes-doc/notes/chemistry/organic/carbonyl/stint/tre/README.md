Urotropine is used as {{c1::medicine to treat uurinary infection}}  ~
The reason for the easy oxidation of aldehyde is {{c1:: presence of hydrogen atom on the carbonyl group}}  ~
The hydrogen group of aldehyde can be converted into {{c1::OH}} group without {{c2::cleavage}} of any bond ~

In oxidation of ketones the keto group always stays preferring the {{c1::smaller alkyl group}}  ~
{{c1::Popoff's rule}} states that the {{c2::keto}} group always {{c2::stays}} with {{c2::smaller}} {{c2::alkyl}} group ~
{{c1::Oxidation}} reactions can be used to {{c2::distinguish}}  between {{c3::aldehydes}} and {{c3::ketones}}  ~
{{c1::Tollen's reagent}} is the {{c2::ammoniacal}} solution of {{c2::Silver nitrate}}  ~


Reaction with {{c1::Tollen's reagent}} is also called {{c2::silver mirror test}} ~

Fehling solution contains {{c1::Fehling solution A }} and {{c1::Fehling solution B}}  ~
{{c1::Fehling soultion A}} is an {{c2::aqueous}} solution of {{c3::copper sulphate}}  ~
