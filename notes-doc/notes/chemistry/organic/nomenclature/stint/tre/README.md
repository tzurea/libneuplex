{{c1::Functional}} group always get the {{c2::lowest possible}} number ~
The numbering starts from the carbon containing functional group except for {{c1::ketone}}  ~
In lowest sum rule the {{c1::numbering of carbon atom}} is {{c2::added}} for every substituents in the parent chain and the {{c3::lowest}} one is chosen ~
In locant rule in every arrangement , the one which has the {{c1::lowest}} location {{c1::first}} is chosen ~
On the case where sum rule and locant rule are contradictory , the rule chosen is {{c1::locant}} rule ~
If the numbering is same in both right to left and left to right direction then , the numbering is done on the basis of {{c1::alphabetical order}}  ~
{{c1::Enyne}} compounds contain {{c2::double}} or {{c2::triple}} bond ~
In the case of {{c1::functional}} group , this group is tried to make the {{c2::lowest}} , cases other than this group , sum and locant rule is applied ~

Carbon atoms are classified into {{c1::primary}} , {{c1::secondary}} , {{c1::tertiary}} and {{c1::quaternary}}  ~
In primary carbon atoms, carbon is bonded to {{c1::1}}  other carbon atoms ~
In secondary carbon atoms, carbon is bonded to {{c1::2}}  other carbon atoms ~
In tertiary carbon atoms, carbon is bonded to {{c1::3}}  other carbon atoms ~
In quaternary carbon atoms, carbon is bonded to {{c1::4}}  other carbon atoms ~

One degree hydrogen is number of {{c1::hydrogen }} atoms bonded to {{c1::one degree carbon atom}}  ~
Two degree hydrogen is number of {{c1::hydrogen }} atoms bonded to {{c1::two degree carbon atom}}  ~
Only {{c1::sigma}} bonded carbon atoms can be classified as 1 degree , 2 degree and 3 degree ~
There is no classification of {{c1::enyne}} compounds ~

{{c1::Common name}} system is also called {{c2::trivial name}}  ~

Source of {{c1::formic acid}} is {{c2::formicus}}  ~
Source of {{c1::acetic acid}} is {{c2::acetum}}  ~
Source of {{c1::butyric acid}} is {{c2::rancid butter}}  ~
Source of {{c1::citric acid}} is {{c2::citurs fruits}}  ~
Source of {{c1::urea}} is {{c2:: urine}}  ~
Source of {{c1::marsh gas}} is {{c2::marshy places}}  ~

On the basis of nature of alkyl groups , carbon atoms are classified into {{c1::N alkyl}} , {{c1::iso alkyl}}  ~
{{c1::N - alkyl}} carbon atoms contain only {{c2::primary}} and {{c2::secondary }} carbon atoms collectively ~
