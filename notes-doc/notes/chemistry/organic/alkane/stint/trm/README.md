Hydrocarbons  : Compounds of carbon and hydrogen
Aromatic hydrocarbons : One six membered carbocyclic ring with alternate single double bond
Saturated hydrocarbons : Four valencies of carbon atom satisfied by four atoms / groups
Unsaturated hydrocarbons : Two carbon atom linked by double / triple bond
Alkanes  : Saturated hydrocarbons containing carbon carbon single bonds
Paraffins : Little reactivity
Open chain  : Open ended carbon chain
Acyclic  : Open ended carbon chain
Cycloalkanes : Carbocyclic compounds resembling aliphatic compounds
Structural isomerism : Isomers differ in arrangement of atoms
Chain isomerism : Structural isomerism in alkanes
Decarboxylation : Remove carbon dioxide from carboxylic acid
