Amines  : Derivative of ammonia 
Simple amines  : Identical alkyl and aryl group 
Mixed amine  : Different alkyl and aryl group 
Aliphatic amine  : Amine attached to one or more alkyl group
Aryl amine  : Nitrogen is directly bonded to aryl group
Aryl alkyl amine  : Nitrogen is bonded to side chain of aromatic ring 
Quarternary ammonium salts  : Replace four hydrogen of ammonium ion by alkyl or aryl group
Chain isomerism  : Difference in structure of alkyl group attached to amino group
Position isomerism  : Difference in position of attachment of amino group
Metamerism  : Difference in alkyl groups attached to nitrogen atom of same functional group 
Ammonolysis : Prepare mixture of amines and qarternary ammonium salts from ammonia and haloalkane
Reductive amination : Reaction of carbonyl compound with ammonia followed by it's reduction
