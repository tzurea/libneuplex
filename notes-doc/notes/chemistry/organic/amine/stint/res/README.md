Cause of inability of reaction of tertiary amine with diethyl oxalate  :
- No replacable hydrogen atoms

Cause of replacing only single ethyl group at secondary amine on treatment with diethyl oxlate :
- Steraic hindrance

Cause of applicability of using fractional distlliation to separate tertiary amine  :
- Tertiary amine is volatile

Cause of applicability of using filtration to separate oxamide and oxamic ester :
- One is solid and other is liquid


Cause of formation of primary amine at excess amine at ammonolysis :
- High probability of reaction of alkyl halide with ammonia rather than between alkyl halide and primary amine

Cause of incapability of formation of aryl amines from ammonolysis :
- Halo arenes do not show nucleophilic substitution reaction

Cause of solubility of lower aliphatic amines below atoms having 6 carbon atoms :
- Hydrogen bonds with water

Cause of insoluble aryl amines :
- Hydrophobic hydrocarbon 

Cause of high boiling points of aryl amines  :
- High molecular mass

Cause of high boiling points of primary amine compared to other degree amines :
- Hydrogen bonds by polar amines in primary and secondary amines

Cause of low boiling point of tertiary amines compared to primary and secondary amines:
- Absence of hydrogen atoms to form hydrogen bonds

Cause of low boiling points of amines than alcohols and carboxylic acids :
- Nitrogen is less electronegative than oxygen in hydrogen bonding

Cause of high boiling points of amines than ether, hydrocarbons, haloalkanes :
- Hydrogen bonding

Cause of amine to exhibit as basic property :
- Lone pair of electrons at nitrogen
- Release of free hydroxyl ions in solutions

Cause of more basic property of aliphatic amines than ammonia :
- + I Inductive effect of alkyl groups


Cause of unexpected behaviour of basicity in aliphatic amines :
- Combined effect of electron releasing tendency and hydration effect
