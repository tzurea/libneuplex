Fluid Dynamics

Viscous force:
Fluid consists of different layers. When the {luid 1s 1n motion there exists an opposing force between
different layers of the fluid. This opposing force is called viscous force.

 
Viscosity:

The property of a fluid (liquid or gas) due to which an internal friction comes into play when

the fluid is in motion and opposes the relative motion of its different layers is called viscosity.

 
 

Cause of viscosity:

In liquid, viscosity is due to cohesive forces between the molecules.

In gas, viscosity is due to the collision of gas molecules.

I Factors affecting the viscosity:
Nature of matenal
Temperature
 

Consider a liquid flowing steadily over a fixed solid horizontal surface as shown in the figure.

Every layer of liquid moves parallel to the fixed surface. The layer in contact with the fixed surface is at
rest while the velocity of other layers increases uniformly upwards. Consider two layers AB and CD
moving with velocity v and v + dv at a distance x and x + dx respectively from the fixed solid surface.

Hence, the coefficient of viscosity of a liquid is defined as the viscous drag or viscous force
acting per unit area of the layer having unit velocity gradient perpendicular to the direction of the
flow of the liquid.
