## Acoustic phenomena

Acoustics  is the branch of physics which deals with the production, transmission, reception, control and effects of sound on both living and non-living materials.

Longitudinal (sound) wave as the pressure wave

In longitudinal wave. particles of the medium execute to & fro motion about their mean position along the direction of wave propagation.

The maximum linear displacement of  particles rom their mean position is called displacement amplitude of wave.

The displacement equation for sound wave travelling in the medium along +ve X-axis can be written as

k is wave number or propagation constant.

When sound propagates in air, alternate regions of maximum

& minimum pressure respectively called compressions &
rarcfactions are produced.


The pressure variation takes place in the medium when
longitudinal wave propagates through the medium, so it is
also called as pressure wave.

Let us consider an imaginary cylinder of air medinm with
cross-sectional area Aâ€™ length Ax and axis along the
dircction of wave propagation as shown i fig(1).

When wave propagates through air, particles displace from
their mean position. Let v, and y, be the displacements of
particles at the left and right ends of cvlinder respectively.
Now the change in volume is

For y2, >y1, . air cylinder expands and for y2 < y1 , . air cylinder is compressed.
