Electrochemical changes are of two typres which are electrochemical cells and electrolytic cells

Electrochemical cells are also caled galvanic cells or voltaic cells.
In electrochemical cells chemical energy is converted into electric energy.
In electrochemical cells redox reaction occurrs.

Dainell cell was constructed by John Daniell.
Daniel cell was constructed in 1836

Daniel cell was contructed based on reaction of zinc with copper ions to give zinc ions and copper

### Electrolytic cells

Electroclytic cells are also called electrolysis
The phenomenon of chemical changes taking place by the passage of electrical energy from an external source is called electrolysis.
The devices used to carry out electrolysis are called electrolytic cdlls.


On electrolysis molten sodium chloride disasscociates to sodium and chlorine.
Sodium in formed on cathode in electrolysis of sodium chloride.
Chlorine is formed on anode in electrolysis of sodum chloride.

Potassium was isolated by H. Day by passing electric current through molten KOH.

Half cells are separate containers in which oxidation and reduction occurs.
Daniell cells consists of solution which are copper sulphate and zinc sulphate

The concentration of copper sulphate in daniell cells is 1.0 M
The concentration of zinc ulphate in daniell cells is 1.0 M


Zinc rod is dipped into ZnSO4 solutlon in daniel cell.
Copper rod is dipped into CuSO4 solution.

In daniel cells inverted U tube contains saturated solution of electrolytes such as KCl, KNO3, NH4NO3
The saturated solution of u tube is taken in agar agar jelly or gelatin.
Openings of U ube are plugged by porous material sch as glass wool or cotton.

Salt bridge connects the two glass beakers.

Electrodes are the surfaces on which oxidation and reduction half reaction occur.
Inert electrodes are those which do not ake part in chemical reactions.

Oxidation occurs at anode.
Reduction occurs at cathode.

Zinc electrode is anode.
Copper electrode is cathode.

Zinc rod is regarded as negative terminal.
Copper rod is regarded as positive terminal.

Salt bridge contains type of electrolytes which are inert.
The mobility of anion and cation of electrolyte in salt bridge should be same.

Salt bridge maintinas the electrical neutrality of half cells solution.

On absence of salt bridge, the electrochemical cells only flows electron very small amount of time.
On abasence of salt bridge, electron will not flow due to accumulation of excessive positive charge at oxidation half cell and excessive negative charge at reduction half cell

The electric potential of the electrochemical chemical cell is 1.10 V when concentration of zinc and copper ions are 1 M

On increasing the external potential beyond 1.10V , the electrochemical cell starts to function as electrolytic cell.
On applying external potential beyond 1.10V, copper dissolves at copper electrode and zinc deposits at zinc electrode.

- When Eext, < 1.1 V 
(1) Electrons flow from Zn rod to
Cu rod
(2) Current flows from Cu to Zn
(3) Zn dissolves at anode and Cu deposits at cathode

- When Eext, = 1.1 V (Fig. 8 b)
(1) No flow of electrons.
(2) No flow of current.
(3) No chemical reaction.

- When Eext, > 1.10 V (Fig. 8 Â¢)
(1) Electrons flow from Cu to Zn.
(2) Current flows from Zn to Cu
(3) Zn is deposited at Zn electrode and Cu dissolves at Cu electrode.
