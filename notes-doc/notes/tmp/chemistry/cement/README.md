# Cement 

* Inorganic material

* Act as a binder which is capable of bonding the constructional materials like sand, stones, bricks, building blocks, iron etc.

* Cements are used for construction of buildings, bridges, dams, roads, run-ways and many more.


* The Principal constituents of cement are the compounds of Ca, Al and Si.

* Cement constituent of Ca compound is called Calcareous 
* The cement  constituent of Al andSi is called argillaceous.

* The cements consists of unique property of setting and hardening of calcareous and argillaceous material under water by virtue of certain chemical reaction within it.

* The hard material thus obtained will have different physical and chemical properties than the initial one.

* The change in properties after hardening of cement is attributed to the exothermic hydration reactions
* Exothermic hydration reactions are initiated upon mixing the binder with water.

 

## Raw material for cement production:

 Starting material for cement production are minerals which are mainly lime, silica, alumina, iron oxide and gypsum.

* The starting material can be classified as
1. Calcareous materials
2.  Argillaceous materials 
3.  Auxiliary components

In Calcareous materials the constituents include Limestone, chalk, marl.

 Argillaceous materials include Clay, shale, slate

Shale are sedimentary rocks

 Auxiliary components: other raw materials

 
Calcareous materials is the lime component.
Argilaceous materials is the clay component


 

### Lime component

1. Lime stone can be obrained from  Calcspar and
aragonite.

Calcspar is also called calcite.
2. Chalk: sedimentary rock, soft (best raw
material especially for the wet process of
cement manufacture),

Blasting is not required for quarrying of chalk .
The crushing process can be omitted when using  chalk.

[+======] 
Chalk contains 98-99% calcium carbonate, small
amount of SiO,, Al,05,and MgCO,.

Marl is carbonate rich mudstone 
Marl contains variable amount of clay and iron oxide.
Widely distributed, so frequently used as raw materials for cement production

Excellent raw material because it contains lime and clay components
Lime and clay are present in homogenized condition in marl.

Marl is softer than limestone

The color of marl depends upon clay substance.
The color of marl ranges from yellow to grayish black.

### Clay components
 

*  Clay components are Formed by weathering of alkali and alkaline earth metals containing aluminum silicates and of their chemical byproducts.
* The chemical byproducts of alkali and alkaline earth metals are  mainly feldspar and mica.

* The main component of clay is formed by hydrated aluminum silicates.

 

* Clay is divided  based upon the type of minerals.

The types of clay are :
1. Kaolin group
2. Montmorillonite group
3. Alkali bearing clay group


1. Molecular formula of  Kaolin group (Al203.2Si02.2H20)
2. Molecular formula of  Montmorillonite group (Al203.3iO2.nH20
3. Molecular formula of Alkali bearing clay group (K20-MgO-AI203- Si02.H20)

Also contain admixtures as iron hroxide, iron sulfide, sand, calcium carbonate etc.

Iron hydroxide is the principal coloring agent in clays.

The colour of clay with no impurities are white.



 
 

### Auxiliary components

The auxiliary components used are 
Magenisum oxide
Alkali
Gypsum


Amount of  Magnesium oxide (MgO) is   2% by weight.
Magenisum oxide is used in clinker phase.
Magnesium oxide Reacts with water to form magnesium hydroxide.

MgO + H20 ----> Mg(OH)2

Mg(OH)2 occupy large volume than MgO .
Mg(OH)2 is formed on the same spot where the MgO is located.
Therefore it can split apart the binding of the hardened cement paste, resulting in expansion cracks magnesia expansion.


MgO appears in limestone mainly in the form of dolomite.
The molecular formula of dolomite is (CaC03.MgCO3)



 Alkalies used are K20 and Na20 from clay and murl.
These compounds are present in the fine
dispersed feldspar, mica and few amount is
obtained from the coal ash.
During the burning process in the rotary kiln, alkalies evaporates in the burning zone, causing  so called alkali circulation.

  

3. Calcium sulphate (Gypsum, CaS04.2H20): it
is soft sulphate material which helps to retard
the setting action of cement. In practice, it
enhances the initial setting time of cement.

4. Sulphur trioxide. Etc.



The percentage of Lime(Ca0)  is 60-67 

The function of lime is to gives high early strength, increase setting time.

The percentage of Silica (Si02) is 17-25
Silica  increase strength, prolong setting time, 
Silica don’t attain their full strength for a considerable period.

Alumina increases the strength and reduce the setting time

The percentage of Alumina  (AI203) is  3-8


The percentage of Iron oxide (F203)   is 0.5-6 
Iron oxide Imparts characteristics grey color, strength and hardness to the portland cement.




The percentage of Magnesium oxide (MgO) is 0.1-4 
Magnesium oxide acts as a filler and accelerates the rate of hardening.

The percentage of Sulfur trioxide  (SO3) is 1-3 
Sulful trioxide Imparts soundness to cement when present on small amount
Alkali oxide  (Na20 K20) 0.3-1.5 
Alkali oxide increases early strength of cement . 
If alkali oxide is present in excess, and causes the cement efflorescent.


Main steps in cement production are

1. Crushing and grinding

2. Blending

3. Burning/mixing

4. Grinding the burned product and packaging

 

* Crushing and grinding:

Hard materials (lime stone and clay) are first crushed and then grind 
Crushing is done usually in a rotating cylindrical ball or tube mills 
The rotating cylindrical ball is provided with a charge of steel grinding balls.
The grinding can be done in wet or dry state depending on the process to be used in.


 For dry grinding the raw materials first may need to be dried in cylindrical rotary dryers.

Soft materials are broken down during vigorous stirring with water in wash mill, producing a fine slurry.

- Blending
This process begins with the acquisition of main raw materials such as limestone, sand and clay.

In blending raw materials are mixed either by the dry process or by the wet process.

In the grinding mill, the dry masses produces a fine ground powder which is stored in bins.

In dry blending process thorough mixing of the dry materials in the silos is ensured by agitation and vigorous circulation induced by compressed air.

In the wet blending process (in the presence of water), of mixing result a slurry in tanks(by mechanical means or compressed air or both).

 

The slurry which contains 35-45% water.
The slurry is adjusted by reducing the water content to 20-30% 
The filter cake is fed to the kiln.

Reduced water content reduces the fuel consumption for burning.

The quality of cement product also depend upon the extent of blending or mixing.

  

Burning

Both dry and wet process feeds rotary kilns where 
Burning results in actual chemical change in cement manufacturing.

This is the important step in cement production.

Different types of kilns are used for burning proposes in cement production.

 

These kilns are up to 200 m long and 6 m in diameter in wet process plant.
However shorter for the dry process which consists of 
Klins for dry process include  steel, cylindrical shell lined with refractory materials.

The raw materials feed, introduced at the upper end, move slowly down the kiln to the lower firing end.

The fuel for firing may be pulverized coal, oil or natural gas 
The fuel is injected through a pipe.

The temperature at the firing end ranges from about 2350 t0 2550°C,
The temperature depends upon the raw materials being used.

Heat exchanger is commonly incorporated at the back end of the kiln.
Heat exchanger is used to increase the heat transfer to the incoming cement raw materials and to reduce the heat lost in the waste gases.

The burnt products  are calcium aluminate and silicates
The burnt products emerge from the kiln as small nodules of clinker.

These passes into coolers, where heat is transferred to incoming air and the product cooled.

The clinker may be immediately ground to cement or stored in stock piles for later use.

 
 
 

 
  

Grinding

From clinker storage, the materialss transported to final grinding stage where it is
ground to the final powdered product.

This is almost similar to the first process.

Here clinker and the required amount of gypsum (3-5%) are ground into a fine powder in horizontal mills.

 

The material may pass straight through the mill which is called open circuit grinding.
The  coarse material is separated from the ground product and returned to the mill for further grinding which is called closed circuit grinding.

Finished cement is pumped pneumatically to storage silos from which it is drawn for packaging in plastic bags or for dispatch in bulk container.
