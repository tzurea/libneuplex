 

* Hepatitis is a communicable disease characterized by the
inflammation of liver.

* It is caused by either viruses or by certain toxins.

* Hepatitis caused by toxins or the poisonous chemicals like carbon tetrachloride, alcohol, vinyl chloride etc. which enter body by swallowing or inhaling or by injection is called toxic hepatitis.

* Hepatitis caused by different types of specific viruses are called
viral hepatitis.

* Hepatitis is also called ‘kamalpitta’ in nepali and may be acute or
chronic.

* It is characterized by fever anorexia, nausea, abdominal
discomfort followed by jaundice.

Anorexia is loss of appetite.

 

Types of viral hepatitis

. Hepatitis A (Infectious hepatitis):

* An acute hepatitis, caused by hepatitis A virus having single stranded
RNA genome.

* This virus is present in faecal matter of patient and hence transmit by
faeco-oral route.

* Mild disease of children and young adults which is characterized by
anorexia, malaise, nausea, diarrhea, fever and chills and jaundice.
* Incubation period is about 15-40 days.

* Diagnosis is done by urine test (to find the level of bile pigment,

protein etc), stool test (presence of virus), serum test (increase in
bilirubin).

* Treatment is done by injection of gamma globulin.

 

2. Hepatitis B (Serum hepatitis)

* Caused by hepatitis B virus also called Dane particle, a DNA virus that live i
blood and other body fluids.

* Most of the liver cancer case is believed to be due to HBV (hepatitis B virus.

* Mode of transmission through unsafe sexual intercourse with infected
person, sharing infected needles, infected mother to new born child,
through saliva, tears, sputum, milk, by blood sucking arthropods like
mosquitoes, bed bug etc.

* The incubation period of this virus is long (about 40-200 days) making this
disease chronic.

* Symptoms are inflammation of liver for long time, persistent nausea,
fatigue, jaundice, liver cirrhosis and cancer.

* Diagnosis is done by serum analysis in which increase in hepatitis B
antibody is observed.

* Prevention and treatment is done by recombinant hepatitis B vaccine and
drugs like Alfa-interferon, Lamivudine.



3. Hepatitis C virus (non-A, non- B hepatitis)
* Caused by hepatitis C virus having RNA as genetic material.

* This disease is found among intravenous drug user, also spread through
sharing tooth brushes, razors, unsafe sex, from infected mother to child etc.

* Incubation period 20-90 days.
* It also cause liver cirrhosis and cancer.
* Treatment and control are like that of hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.

4. Hepatitis D ( Delta hepatitis)

* It is caused by hepatitis D virus having RNA as genetic material.

* Only the person infected with hepatitis B can become infected with hepatitis
D.

* Mode of transmission occurs through infected blood, unsafe sex, perforation
of skin by contaminated needles and incubation period is about 30-50 days.

* HDV is a defective virus for which HBV is a helper.

 

* This disease also results severe liver damage and fatality rate is
higher.

* For prevention vaccine against hepatitis B is effective.

. Hepatitis E
* Caused by hepatitis E virus, having RNA as genetic material.

* Infection through faeco-oral route and hence spreads through
contaminated water and food.

* High mortality among pregnant woman.

* Incubation period is about 15-60 days.

* Symptoms similar to hepatitis A and bilirubins level are usually
higher, jaundice deeper and prolonged.

* Personal cleanliness, boiled water, properly cooked and clean food,
control of flies etc are preventive measures.
