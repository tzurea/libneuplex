Cholera

. Introduction:

= Cholera Is the acute Infection of the small Intestine
which can kill the victim within few hours if left
untreated.

- It is caused due to poor sanitation and by the
Iingestion of food or water contaminated with the
bacterium Vibrio cholero.

= Since the time immemorial, Cholera has caused
pandemics in Asia and Africa

= It is an extremely virulent dlsease which cause severe
acute diarrhea which affect both children and adults.

= Finally, the patient dies due to the loss of electrolytes
and water from the body.
= Cholera has been nicknamed ‘blue death’ because a
g‘c;son's skin may turn bluish.gray by the extreme loss
lubds.

* According to WHO, cholera spread across the
world from its original reservoir in the Ganges
delta in India during 19" century.

* There was six subsequent pandemics, killed
million of people across all continents.

* The seventh pandemic started in south Asla in
1961, reach to Africa in 1971 and USA in 1991,

* Cholera is now endemic in many countries.

* This disease is characterized by the large amounts
of watery diarrhea, vomiting, muscular cramps
which lead to dehydration and electrolyte
imbalance,

* Cholera occurs only in human.
*  

. Causative agent:

— Cholera is caused by a gram-negative, comma
shaped bacterium called Vibrio cholera which
contains a single polar flagellum.

= This bacteria is 1.5 to 2um in length 0.3-0.5 um
wide.

= It was cultured for the first time by Robert Koch in
1883,

= There are many sero group of V. cholera but two
sero group 01 and 0139 cause outbreaks.

- Characteristically, Vibrios grows at a very high pH
8.5-9.5 and are rapidly killed by acid.

 

3. Source of infection:

= The source of infection is the sufferers when
their untreated diarrheal discharge is allowed to
get into ground water, soil and drinking water
supplies.
= Flies also carry bacteria from faeces to food
materials.
4. Mode of transmission:

~ Transmission is usually through faeco-oral route
of contaminated food and water caused by poor
sanitation.

- Most cholera cases in developing countries are
as a result of contaminated water and
contaminated food.

 

5. Incubation period:

* The incubation period of bacteria is about 24-72 hours,

6. Clinlcal features:

* This bacterium adheres to the mucosa of small intestine and
secretes a cholera toxin called choleragen.

= Cholera induces the secretion of water and chioride ions
and in the absorption of sodium jons in the intestines.

* Now, the patients loss water and electralyte.

* During infection patients can lose 10-15 Ftres of fluid,

* Cramging of abdominal muscles, vomiting, lever and watery
diarrohea are the symptoms,

* Patients become lethargic, might have sunken eyes, dry
mouth, dammy skin or wrinkled hands and feet,

* A deep and labored breathing can occur,

+ Blood pressure drops due to dehwdration, paripheral pulse Is
rapid and the urine output decreases.

« If untreated, the patient goes to coma and death may occur.

 

7. Diagnosis:

* Laboratory diagnosis of the bacterium is done by culture
from faeces and agglutination reaction with specific
antisera.

* Blood test

= Dipstick test

8. Preventive measures:

* The patients should be immediately re-hydrated with NaCl
and sucrose solution, supplemented with zinc frequently,

+ The antibiotics recommended to patients are tetracycline,
trimethoprime, sulfamethoxazole or ciprofloxacin.

* Oral vactines of cholera e.g, Dukoral, sanchol,
Ewlmow:mm can be administered.

r disposal and treatment of all materials | bed, dothes

ar. that are contacted with cholera victims faeces,

 

* In cholera affected areas, sewage and faecal sludge
need to be treated and managed carefully to stop the
spread of disease via human excreta.

* Proper sanitation of water supply must be done
carefully,

* Making people awareness against cholera and hand
washing with soap or ash after using a toilet and
before handling food materials.

* Taking care of 4 F's: fly, food, filth, and faeces.
