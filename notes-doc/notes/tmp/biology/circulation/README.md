Human Circulatory System
![[Pasted image 20220107100920.png]]

Blood vessels are divided into  Artery, Vein and capillaries

Outer covering of blood vessels is tunica externa
Middle covering of blood vessels is tunica media
Inner covering of blood vessels is tunica interna
Tunica externa made up of fibrous tissue
Tunica media made up of smooth muscles and elastic tissues


Tunica media is thicker in arteries than in veins.
Arteries remain open when cut
Veins collapse when cut

Tunica interna or endothelium made up of simple squamous epithelium
Capillaries have endothelium only
The vessels of vessels are vaso vasorum 
Function of vaso vasorum is to supply blood to large blood vessels

Pulse is the  wave of distension
Bradycardia is a condition where heart beat  is below 60 bpm
Tachycardia is a condition where  heart beat over 100 bpm
Heart murmer is the  condition due to malfunctioning of valves
Heart murmer causes turbulent blood flow producing
Whooshing heart sounds is due to hear murmer

Arterial System is a  system of arteries that transport blood away from the heart
Arterial System includes pulmonary and systemic circulation.

Pulmonary circulation includes Pulmonary artery 
The only artery that transports deoxygenated blood is pulmonary artery
Pulmonary artery transports blood from right ventricle to lungs for oxygenation

Systemic circulation  includes aorta .
Its arteries to distribute oxygenated blood from left ventricle throughout the body

 
Aorta is further divided into:
Ascending Aorta 
Aortic Arch 
Dorsal Aorta 

Dorsal aorta is further divided into 
Thoracic aorta 
Abdominal Aorta

The coronary arteries arise from the base of ascending aorta.
The aortic arch supplies blood to anterior aspects of body.

Aortic arch has three arteries which are: 
- Brachiocephalic artery or Innominate artery 
- - Left common carotid artery
- Left subclavian artery

![[Pasted image 20220107102536.png]]

Brachiocephalic artery  immediately bifurcates into
right common carotid 
right subclavian arteries.

 

Right common carotid artery further
divides into:
 
External carotid artery
Internal carotid artery

External carotid artery supplies  blood to face, forehead, neck

Internal carotid artery supplies brain, eyes



Right Subclavian artery gives rise to :

Internal mammary artery 
Vertebral artery
Axillary artery

Internal mammary artery supplies thoracic region and mammary glands
Vertebral artery supplies neck and brain

Axillary artery supplies forelimbs and scapular  region

Axillary artery divides into 
 Brachial artery 
 radial and Ulnar arteries  
 Palmer arteries 
 Digital arteries 

 Brachial artery supplies arm
 radial and Ulnar arteries  Supplies forearm
 Palmer arteries supplies palm
 Digital arteries supplies fingers

 Circle of Willis is also called Circulus arteriosus 
 Circle of Willis is divided into two internal carotids and 2 vertebral arteries  supply the brain

 Left common carotid similar to right common carotid but supplies head , neck,eyes, forehead and brain
 Left subclavian artery similar to right subclavian but supplies left body parts

Dorsal aorta arises from aortic arch

Thoracic aorta supplies thoracic regions 
Thoracic aorta is  further divided into:
Intercoastal arteries
Oesophageal arteries
Bronchial arteries

Intercoastal arteries supplies the intercoastal muscles

There are 11 pairs of posterior intercoastal arteries 
There are 9 pairs of anterior intercoastal arteries

Oesophageal arteries  supplies Oesophagus

 Bronchial arteries  supplies lungs 
 There are 2 bronchial arteries to left lung
Therre are 1 bronchial  arteries to right lung

Femoral artery
Popliteal artery 
Anterior tibial artery
Posterior tibial artery
 Dorsalis pedis artery  

Femoral artery supplies the thigh region

Popliteal artery supplies the knee

Anterior tibial artery supplies the lower leg.

Venous system


VENOUS SYSTEM:

* system of veins which carry the deoxygenated blood to heart except pulmonary veins
which carry the oxygenated blood.

* Inferior vena cava is the largest vein in the body.
* Veins have valves in them.

* Venous system includes:

1. Pulmonary circulation

. i?crzlludes two pairs of pulmonary veins which carry oxygenated blood to the left auricle
of heart

1. Systemic circulation
* includes:

- the superior vena cava which carries the deoxygenated blood from upper extremities of
oqy

- the inferior vana cava which carries the deoxygenated blood from the lower extremities of
body

coronary sinus which drains the deoxygenated blood from heart itself collected by
coronary veins and opens to right auricle

![[Pasted image 20220119120059.png]]

1. Superior vanacava:

* |t collects the venous blood from head, neck, vertebra , thoracic regions
and forelimbs.

* |t is made up of fusion of left and right brachiocephalic veins and lies
above the heart

a. Right brachiocephalic vein
- It is formed by the fusion of :
i. Right internal jugular vein ( collects blood from brain and eyes)

ii. Right external jugular vein ( collects blood from face, forehead, neck
and ears of right part of body)

iii. Right sub-clavian vein

It is formed by the union of veins that collect venous blood from right
forelimb, scapular regions, thoracic regions , neck and vertebra by the help
of following veins.

 

- Digital veins: collects blood from digits

- Palmer veins: collects blood from palm

- Radial and ulnar veins: collects blood from forearm

- Median cubital vein: collects blood from arm where venipuncture is done

- Basilic vein: collects blood from medial surface of biceps

- Cephalic vein: collects blood from lateral surface of biceps

- axillary vein: collects blood from forelimb through brachial and cephalic veins
- vertebral vein: collects blood from vertebra and neck

- internal mammary vein: collects blood from chest and mammary glands

The Azygous vein collects venous blood from thoracic regions by the help of
intercoastal veins, oesophageal vein and bronchial vein and opens directly into
Superior vena cava.

b. Left Brachiocephalic vein:

It is the vein formed by the union of:

-left internal jugular vein

  
  

- Left external jugular vein

- left subclavian vein ( formed by the union of digital. palmer., radial, ulnar,
median cubital, cephalic, basilic, axillary and internal mammary veins)

- Also the Hemi-azygous vein that collects the venous blood from intercoastal
regions, oessophagus and lungs open into the left brachiocephalic vein.

Therefore, the superior vena cava is formed by the union of right and left

brachiocephalic veins.


 
      
 

2. Inferior vena cava: (largest vein)
* Drains most of the blood from the body below the diaphragm to the right atrium.

. Formgd by the union of the two common iliac veins at the level of the 5th lumbar
vertebra.

Tributaries of Inferior vena cava:

- Two common iliac veins

- Four paired lumbar veins

- Right gonadal vein

- Left gonadial vein drains into the left renal vein
- Paired renal veins

- Right suprarenal vein

- Left supra renal vein drains into the left renal vein
- Hepatic veins drain blood from liver

- Paired inferior phrenic veins.

( left renal is formed by the union of left supra renal, left gonadial and the renal
vein itself.

Hepatic Portal System:

 

  

* The flow of deoxygenated blood from the digestive organs to the liver before
returning to the heart is hepatic portal circulation.

* A vein which does not carry blood directly to the heart but forms a network of
capillaries in another or immediate organ before reaching the heart is called a portal
vein.

* Hepatic portal system collects the venous blood from alimentary canal, p ,
gall bladder and spleen to liver before passing directly to the inferior venal cava henc
named as hepatic portal system.

- The portal vein is formed by the union of following veins that carry venous blood
from stomach, spleen, gall bladder, pancreas and duodenum which are:

- superior mesenteric veins: from small intestine
- Inferior mesenteric veins: from large intestine
- splenic veins: from spleen

- Gastric veins: from stomach
Cystic veins: from the gaiibiadd
- Pancreatic veins: from pancreas

   ![[Pasted image 20220119120530.png]]
   ![[Pasted image 20220119120538.png]]

    

- Immediately before reaching the liver, the portal vein divides into
right and left portal veins that enter the liver and the venous blood
passes in the liver sinusoids. Later hepatic vein connects the inferior
vena cava transporting the venous blood from the portal system as
well as liver itself.

Significance:

* Assimilation of nutrients eg: Glycogenesis (excess of glucose is
converted into glycogen); Lipogenesis; Gluconeogenesis (formation of
glucose or glycogen from non carbohydrate sources)

* Detoxification( Harmful nitrogenous waste like ammonia is converted
into urea)

* Liver produces blood proteins which are put into blood circulation

 

* The veins that collect blood from legs are:
- Anterior and Posterior tibial veins

- Popliteal vein

- Great Saphenous vein ( longest vein: drains venous blood from lower leg to
femoral vein)

- Small Saphenous vein ( drains the venous blood from lower leg to popliteal
vein)

- Femoral vein
* The femoral becomes the external iliac vein.
* Externaliliac join internal iliac to form common iliac veins.

* Both right and left common iliac veins form inferior vena cava that drains the
entire low part of the body.

* Finally, the Inferior vena cava drains venous blood from lower extremities of
body into right atrium.
