Population is defined as the group of individuals of the same species that live in a particular area at a particular time.

The study of human population is called demography.

The scientific study of the changes or variations of size and density of individuals of a particular population in a definite specified area is called population dynamics.



Natality is derived from latin word natalis.
In latin  natalis means to born
The rate of births per unit time. It is denoted as the number of births per 1,000 individuals in the population per year is natalis.
 
Mortality is derived from latin word mortalis.
In latin mortalis means to die.
The rate of deaths per unit time. It is the number of deaths per 1,000 individuals per year is mortality
  

Biotic potehtial  is the physiological capacity of the organism to produce offspring, 
Biotic potential is also called reproductive potential.

 

Carrying capacity is the capacity of an area or particular habitat that can support the maximum  number -of species through out the seasons.


Sex ratio is  the ratio between male and female in a given population is called sex ratio.

Census: It is an official count of the people of a country , state or district with statistics such as sex, education etc.

 

Malthus Theory of Human Population Growth was given by Thomas Robert Malthus,
Thomas Robert Malthus was a British economist

Thomas Robert Malthus proposed the facts of population growth , resource growth , imbalance and consequence of imbalance.


Population grows in geometric ratio
Food resources multiplies in arithmetic ratio.

Faster growth of population creates imbalance in nature.
 

When the imbalance reaches a certain limit, environmental factors such as famines, malnutrition, earthquakes, floods, wars, drought, epidemics etc. reduces the population
The population size after imbalance is reduced to the size  that could be supported by the available resources.


 
 
 Population Growth Curves  is a graph showing the number of individuals in a population over the time.
 
 It is an important tool for studying the pattern
of population growth. It is of following types:

The types of population growth curves are J shaped curve and

J shaped curve is also called expnential growth curve.

In exponential gowth curve , the phases are lag phase and exponential phase


In lag phase the population increases slowly and gradually  beacuse the animals are few in number 

Exponential phase occurs  after the species getting adjusted with the nature,

The population increases rapidly exponential phase
The ration in  exponential phase is geometric ratio.

Algae, Animal Plants, Microbes


 In this case the, the growth curve takes the
shape of the letter J. 
In this pattern of growth the density reaches to the upper limit and remains
constant for some time then declines suddenly.

 

b.S-shaped curve : Sigmoid curve is a typical
growth curve characteristic of many species
when introduced to a new habitat. It has
following phases:

 

Early phase or Lag phase: It is slowly growing
phase. There is no growth or little growth in
population.

- Middle phase ( Log or exponential phase) : In
the beginning the growth is slow but soon it
becomes fast, reproduces and grows rapidly
owing to the favourable environmental
conditions.

 

 Stationary or Zero growth phase: It is the last
phase in which the growth remains constant i.e.
there is no further increase due to equal birth rate
and death rate.

Consequences of overpopulation

Socio-economic problems

a ) Space: New towns and cities are coming up to
accommodate the growing population. This has put a
great strain on agricultural lands and forest areas.

 

b ) Food supply: It will lead to the food crisis resulting in
families, hunger and poor health. They suffer from
malnutrition and increase the handicapped members in
the society.
