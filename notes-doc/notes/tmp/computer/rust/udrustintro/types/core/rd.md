Variables are initialized by let [variable_name] : [variable_type] = [value];
u variable type stands for unsigned.
u8 variables type stands for unsigned 8 bits.
Text is printed by the statement println!();

Text formatting while printing is done by println!( " [var] = {}" , var);
To change the value after declaring it , the mut keyword must be used.

i variable type stands or signed integer.
i32 variable type stands for signed 32 bit integer.

Other libaraires are imported by using use statement.
The libarary for memory functions is std::mem
Size of value of varibale var is given by mem::size_of_val(&var)
Bits of signed and unsigned variable 8 , 16 , 32 and 64

isize and usize variable types are integral data types.

Character variable types are initialized by char
Floating point variable types of 64 bit are stated as f64
Boolean variable values are true and false .
