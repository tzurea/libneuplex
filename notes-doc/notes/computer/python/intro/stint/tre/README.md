-- Basic principles of learning a programming language

{{c1::Rectangular boxes}} represent {{c2::action }} in flowchart ~
{{c1::Diamond boxes}} represent {{c2::decision point}} in flowchart ~
The step to take during programming is {{c1::think}} , {{c1::code}} , {{c1::test}} , {{c1::debug}} and {{c1::repeat}}  ~
In the think step the {{c1::algorithm}} is formulated ~
In the code step the {{c1::algorithm}}  is implemented ~
In the test step the {{c1::actual}} output is to be matched with {{c1::expected}} output ~
An {{c1::implementation}} is the way you write to solve a {{c2::task}}  ~
Peusdo code is the mix of {{c1::English}} and {{c1::programming}}  ~
A {{c1::comment}} is a line in python that starts with {{c2::#}} character which is {{c2::ignored}} by the interpreter ~

-- Introduction to python

Python was created by {{c1::Guido von rossum}}  ~
{{c1::Expressions}} are those that can be {{c2::evaluated}}into a {{c2::value}}   ~
{{c1::Bug}} is an {{c2::error}} in the program ~
{{c1::Statements}} are {{c2::commands}}  ~
The statement to print expression values to the console is {{c1::print()}}  ~

- Variables

{{c1::Equal sign}} stands for {{c2::assignment}}  ~
In python everything is an {{c1::object}}  ~
An object is divided into {{c1::type}} and {{c1::set of operations}}  ~
A {{c1::variable}} is used to bind a {{c2::name}} to an {{c2::object}}  ~
Variables must begin with {{c1::letters}} or an {{c1::underscore}}  ~
Allowed characters in variables names are {{c1::letters}} , {{c1::numbers}} and {{c1::underscores}}  ~
The lines must be limited at  most to {{c1::80 }} characters ~
A {{c1::keyword}} is a {{c2::reserved}} special word that has special meaning in a programming  language ~
A {{c1::variable initialization}} binds the {{c2::variable name}} to an object  ~
The python operation to show the {{c1::identity  }} of an object in the form of {{c2::sequence of digits}} is {{c3::id()}}   ~

- Object types and statements

Characteristics are called data {{c1::attributes}} or {{c1::values}}  ~
Actions are called {{c1::operations}} on the type ~
An object {{c1::type}} tells what kinds of {{c2::values}} the object can have ~
Few types of objects which are the basic building blocks of each language are called {{c1::primitives}} or {{c1::scalars}}  ~
Number of basic types of objects in python is {{c1::5}}  ~
The basic types of python are {{c1::integers}} , {{c1::floating point}} , {{c1::booleans}} , {{c1::strings}} and a {{c1::special type}} representing absence of value ~
An object of type {{c2::integer}}  is an object whose values are {{c1:: real whole numbers. }} ~
Object of type {{c2::integer}} is represented by {{c1::int}}  ~
The shorthand for x = x + 1 is {{c1::x += 1}}  ~
The shorthand for x = x - 1 is {{c1::x -= 1}}  ~
The shorthand for x = x / 1 is {{c1::x /= 1}}  ~
The shorthand for x = x * 1 is {{c1::x *= 1}}  ~
