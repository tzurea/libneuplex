Cause of not using ordinary galvanometer to measure direction of current  :
- Depends on magnetic field
- Deflects one direction for one half.
- Deflects other direction for next half.
- Can't see pointer even due to persistence of vision .

Cause of same phase at purely resistive circuit :
- Both current and voltage are functions of same quantity [$] \omega t [/$]  

Cause of flow of current in presence of capacitor at ac :
- Charging at positive half cycle
- Discharging at negative half cycle
- No net charge
