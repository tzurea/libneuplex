Alternating current  : Change magnitude continuous . Reverse direction periodic. 
Current amplitude  : Maximum value attained by alternating current in either direction 
Time period  : Time taken to complete one cycle by coil in magnetic field
Frequency  : Number of cycles completed per second 
Mean value  : Value of direct current which sends same change as sent by ac in half time period
Root mean square value of ac : Value of direct current produce same heating effect as produced by ac 
Root mean square value of alternating emf  : Value of steady voltage produce same heating effect as produced by alternating emf
1 Ampere current in ac  : Rms value of ac produce same amount of heat as one ampere direct current
Hot wire instruments  : Instruments based on heating effect of current 
Form factor  : Ratio of virtual value and mean value 
Phasor : Rotating vector representing sinusodially varying quantity
Phasor diagram : Diagram represent ac and voltage with same frequency and phase angle
Capacitive reactance : Opposition offered by capacitor for the flow of ac
