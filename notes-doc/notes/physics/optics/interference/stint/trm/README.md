Coherent sources : Two sources of light having same frequency and zero or constant phase difference
Incoherent sources : Two sources of light without constant phase difference
Interference term : [$] 2 \sqrt{I_1I_2}\cos \phi [/$]  
Interference of light  : Redistribution of intensity of light in region of superposition
Constructive interference : Addition of amplitude by coincidence of crests and trough of wave
Destructive interference : Subtraction of amplitude by incidence of crests of a wave on  trough of another and vice versa
Interference fringes  : Alternate light and dark band on observation screen
Optical path : Distance travelled by light in vacuum at a time such that the light is propagating in a medium 
Fringe width  : Separation between two sucessive bright or dark fringe
