Cause of using single source in production of coherent sources :
- Relative phase difference will remain constant with time


Cause of using monochromatic light in production of coherent sources  :
- Fringes of different colours will overlap

Cause of small path difference in production of coherent sources  :
- Prevent general illumination


Cause of absence of coherence in two independent sources :
- Emission of light by individual atoms
- Large number of atoms at tiny sources
- Very very short period of time for emission of unbroken wave

Cause of uniform illumination in in light from independent sources  :
- Eyes can't detect rapid change of interference pattern
