A parallel beam of light of wavelength of 600nm is incident normally on a slit of width 'a'. If the distance between the slits and the screen is 0.8 m and the distance of 2nd order maximum from the centre of the screen is 15 mm , calculate the width of the slit :
- [$] x_2 = \frac{5}{2} \frac{D \lambda}{a} [/$]  
- [$] a = \frac{5}{2}\frac{D \lambda }{x_2} [/$]  


Two wavelengths of sodium light 590 nm , 596 nm are used in turn to study the diffraction taking place at a single slit of aperture 2x10 to the power -6 m . The distance between the slit and the screen is 1.5 m. Calculate the separation of between the positions of the first maximum of the diffraction pattern obtained in the two cases :
- [$] x_2 - x_1 =frac{3D}{2a}(\lambda_2 - \lambda_1) [/$]
