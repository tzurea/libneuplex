Diffraction of light : Bending of light around corners and spreading into geometrical shadows
Angular width of central maximum : Angular separation between the direction of first minima on two sides of central maximum
Half angular width of central maximum : Directions of first minima on either side of central maximum
Angular width of nth secondary maximum : Angular separation between directions of nth and (n+1)th minima
Fresnel's distance : Distance of equality of diffraction spread and size of aperture
