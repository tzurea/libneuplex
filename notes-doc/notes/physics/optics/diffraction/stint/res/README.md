Cause of formation of diffraction in light waves :
- Curving of waves emerging out of corners

Cause of not seeing diffraction of light easily around us :
- Wavelength of light is much smaller compared to size of objects


Cause of seeing diffraction of sound easily around us
- Wavelength of sound waves is comparable with size of objects around us

Cause of diffraction at single slit :
- Source of secondary wavelets at same phase by all points of slit

Cause of production of dark fringe when path difference is equal to wavelength :
- Wavelets of two halves reach fringe in opposite phases

Cause of approximational validity of the term [$] \sin \theta_n = n \frac{\lambda}{a}  [/$]   :
- [$] \lambda << a [/$]   

Cause of production of secondary maxima :
- First two wavelets will interfere destructively
- Third part of wavelet will contribute to intensity 


Cause of intensity of central maximum :
- Constructive interfernce of wavelets from all parts of the slits

Cause of formation of central bright fringe by two corresponding points from the two halves of slit :
- Zero path difference
