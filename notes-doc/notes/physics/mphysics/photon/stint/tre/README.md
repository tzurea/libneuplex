{{c1::Stopping }} potential is also called {{c2::cut off}} potential or {{c3::retarding }} potential ~
Sign of stopping potential is {{c1::negative}}  ~
At stopping potential , {{c1::kinetic}} energy gained by {{c2::electrons}} is balanced by {{c3::stopping potential}}   ~
Einstein's photo electric equation deals about the {{c1::conservation of energy}} ~
Before and after the emissino of electrons {{c1::energy}} remains {{c2::constant}}  ~
