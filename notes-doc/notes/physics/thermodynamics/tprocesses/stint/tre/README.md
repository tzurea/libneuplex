 A {{c1::thermodynamic process}} is said to occur if the {{c2::thermodynamic variables}} of a {{c2::system}} {{c2::change with time}}   ~
The different types of thermodynamic processes are {{c1::isothermal }} process, {{c1::isobaric }} process , {{c1::iso choric }} process and {{c1::adiabatic }} process ~
{{c1::Isothermal}} process occurs at a {{c2::constant temperature}}  ~
{{c1::Iso baric}} process occurs at a {{c2::constant pressure}}   ~
{{c1::Iso choric}} process occurs at a  {{c2::constant volume}}  ~
{{c1::Adiabatic }} process is a thermodynamic process in which {{c2:: there is no exchange of heat energy}} between {{c2::system}} and {{c2::surrounding}}   ~
{{c1::Quasi static}} process is a {{c2::infinitely}} {{c2::slow}} process in which {{c2::system}} remains in {{c2::thermal}} and {{c2::chemical equilibrium}} with the {{c2::surroundings}}    ~

{{c1::Isothermal}} process is one in which {{c2:: pressure}} and {{c2::volume}} of the system change but {{c2::temperature}} remains {{c2::constant}}   ~
In isothermal process walls of the container must be {{c1::perfectly}} conducting to allow {{c1::exchange of heat}} between the {{c1::system}} and the {{c1::surroundign}}   ~
The process of compression and expansion in isothermal process must be {{c1::very}} slow to provide {{c1::sufficient time for exchange of heat}}  ~
Mathematical equation for isothermal process is ~
In an ideal gas in isothermal process change in intenal energy of the gas is {{c1::zero}} because {{c1::temperature remains constant}}  ~
Expression of first law of thermodynamics in iso thermal processs is ~
When gas expands isothermally , amount of {{c1::heat}} equivalent to {{c1::work done}} by the gas has to be {{c1::supplied}} from {{c1::external source}}   ~
When gas compresses isothermally amount of {{c1::heat}} equivalent to {{c1::work done}} on the gas has to be {{c1::removed}} from the {{c1::gas}}  ~
Work element for work done in isothermal process is given by ~
Pressure for n moles of gas in terms of temperature and volume is given by ~
Derive work done during isothermal process  ~
Expression of work done during isothermal process is in terms of pressure is given by ~
Expression of work done during isothermal process is in terms of volume is given by ~
