The {{c1::first law of thermodynamics}} states that if some {{c2::heat}} is supplied to a {{c2::system}} which is capable of {{c2::doing work}} , then the quantity of {{c2::heat absorbed }} by the system will be {{c2::equal}} to the {{c2::sum}} of {{c2::increase}} in {{c2::internal energy}} and {{c2::external work done}} by the system on the {{c2::surroundings}}   ~
Mathematical relationship of first law of thermodynamics is {{c1::}}  ~
