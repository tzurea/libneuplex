Thermodynamics is the branch of science that deals with {{c1::heat}} and {{c1::temperature}} and the {{c1::interconversion }} of {{c1::heat}} into {{c1::other forms of energy}}  ~

{{c1::Thermodynamic system}} is an {{c2::assembly}} of {{c2::very large number of particles}} having certain value of {{c2::pressure}} , {{c2::volume}} and {{c2::temperature}}  ~
{{c1::Surrounding}} is everything {{c2::outside the system}} which can have {{c2::direct effect}} on the {{c2::system}}  ~
{{c1::Thermodynamic variables}} are the {{c2::quantities}} which help us to {{c2::study behaviour of thermodynamic system}}  ~
{{c1::Equation of state}} is the {{c2:: mathematical relation }} between {{c2::pressure, }} {{c2::volume}} and {{c2::temperature}}    ~
Mathematically equaiton of state is given by  ~

Two systems are said to be in {{c1::thermal equilibrium}} with each other if they have the {{c2::same temperature}}  ~
A system is said to be in {{c1::thermodynamic equilibrium}} if the {{c2::macroscopic variables}} describing the {{c2::thermodynamic state}} do not {{c2::change with time}}  ~
{{c1::Mechanical equilibrium}} is present when there is no {{c2::unbalanced force}} in it's {{c2::interior}} or {{c2::between the system and surroundings}}   ~
{{c1::Chemical equilibrium}} is present when there is no {{c2::spontaneous change }} in {{c2::internal structure}} due to {{c2::chemical reaction }} or {{c2::diffusion}}  ~


{{c1::Zeroth law of thermodynamics}} states that if two systems A and B are {{c2::separately }} in {{c2::thermal equilibrium}} with C then A and B are also in {{c2::thermal equilibrium}} with each other   ~
Temperature is such a property whose {{c1::equality}} is needed for {{c1::thermal equilibrium}}  ~

{{c1::Internal energy }} of the system is   {{c2:: sum }} of {{c2::molecular kinetic }} and {{c2::potential}} energies in {{c2::frame of reference}} relative to which {{c2::the center of mass }}  of the system is at {{c2::rest}}  ~
Intemolecular potential energy is a function of {{c1::volume}}  because work is done {{c1:: against the intermolecular force of attraction}}  ~
Potential energy {{c1::increases}} as volume {{c1::increases}}  ~
Internal kinetic energy of a gas is a function of {{c1::temperature}}  ~
Internal kinetic energy of a gas {{c1::increases}} as temperature {{c1::increases}}  ~
Internal kinetic energy is denoted by {{c1::U}}  ~
Internal energy of a system is a {{c1::thermodynamic state}} variable that is , it does not depend on {{c1::path to current state}}  ~
Internal energy of an ideal gas is purely {{c1::kinetic}}  ~
Heat is a mode of {{c1::energy transfer}} that is due to {{c1::temperature difference}} between {{c1::surrounding}} and the {{c1::system}}  ~
Work is a mode of {{c1::energy transfer}} that is brought about by means that {{c1::do not involve temperature difference}}  ~
Heat produces {{c1::random}} motion whereas work produces {{c1::organised}} motion  ~

Heat {{c1::absorbed by }} a system is {{c2::positive}}   ~
Heat {{c1::given by }}  a system is {{c2::negative}}  ~
Work done {{c1::by a system}} is {{c2::positive}}  ~
Work done {{c1::on a system}} is {{c2::negative}}  ~
The {{c1::increase}} in internal energy of a system is {{c2::positive}}  ~
The {{c1::decrease}} in internal energy of a system is {{c2::negative}}  ~
{{c1::Indicator diagram}} is the graphical representation of {{c2::state of a system}} with the help of {{c2::two thermodynamical variables}}  ~
{{c1::Indcator}} is a device that measures {{c2::change in volume and pressure}}  ~
Indicator diagram for compression is ~
Indicator diagram for expansion is ~
The {{c1::area}} under {{c2::PV}} diagram is numerically equal to {{c2::work done by a system }} or {{c2::on the system}}   ~
Change in volume of the gas in analytical method for work done during expansion is given by ~
Work element in analytical method for the work done during expansion is given by  ~
Work done by a gas when it's volume increases from V1 to V2 is ~

{{c1::Non cyclic }} process is one in which system {{c2::does not return to it's }} {{c2::inital state}}  ~
During expansion area under the PV diagram is traced in {{c1::clockwise direction}}  ~
Durin compression area under the PV diagram is traced in {{c1::anti clockwise}} directin ~
Work done by the gas during expansion is {{c1::positive}}  ~
Work done by the gas during compression is {{c1::negative}}  ~


{{c1::Cyclic }} process is one in which the system {{c2::returns to it's initial state}} after undergoing {{c2::series of changes}}  ~
Derive from cyclic process work down per cycle is numerically equal to area of the loop representing the cycle ~
Work done per cycle is numerically equal to {{c1::area of loop}} representing the cycle	 ~
If the closed loop is traced in {{c1::clockwise}} direction {{c2:: compression }} curve lies below {{c2:: expansion }} curve  and work done is {{c2::positive}} ~
If the closed loop is traced in {{c1:: anti clockwise}} direction {{c2:: expanison}} curve lies below {{c2::compression }} curve and work done is {{c2::negative}}  ~
