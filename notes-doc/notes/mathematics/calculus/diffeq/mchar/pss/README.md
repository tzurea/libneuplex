Solve linear differential equation  : 
- Multiply both sides by integrating factor
- Reduce LHS to derivative of a perfect term
- Integrate both side


Derive integrating factor of linear differential equations :
[ Multiply . Resolve . Integrate ]
- Multiply both sides by k
- Resolve LHS into derivative of product of k and y
- Equate resolved LHS and multiplied linear differential equation
- Integrate both sides
