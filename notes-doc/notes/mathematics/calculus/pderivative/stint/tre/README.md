The partial derivative of a function f(x,y)  with respect to c at the point [$] (x_{0} , y_{0}) [/$] is {{c1:: [$] \frac{\delta f}{\delta x} = \frac{d}{dx} f(x,y_{0}) [/$]  }}   ~
{{c1::y}} is constant on partial differentiation of z = f(x,y) with respect to {{c2::x}}   ~
{{c1::x}} is constant on partial differentiation of z = f(x,y) with respect to {{c2::y}}   ~
Partial differentiation of z = f(x,y) with respect to x , [$] \frac{delta z}{\delta x} [/$] is denoted by {{c1:: [$] f_{x} [/$]  }} ~ 
Partial differentiation of z = f(x,y) with respect to y , [$] \frac{delta z}{\delta y} [/$] is denoted by {{c1:: [$] f_{y} [/$]  }} ~
