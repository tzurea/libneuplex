Cartesian co ordinate  equation of circle at centre (0,0) is ~
Polar co ordinate equation of circle at centre (0,0) is ~
Parametric equation of circle is ~
In parametric equation , x and y are represented as {{c1::function of a parameter}}  ~
In circle in parametric equation, the parameter is {{c1::angle}}  ~
If the constant a is equal in parametric equation the equation represents a {{c1::circle}}  ~
If the constant a are not equal in parametric equation the equation represents a {{c1::ellipse}}  ~
To solve the parametric equation the only thing to be considered is to {{c1::remove the parameter}}  ~
On parametric equation , the parameter is removed by {{c1::squaring }}  and {{c1::adding}}  ~
In circle the coefficent of square of x and coefficient of square of y is {{c1::always equal}}  ~
