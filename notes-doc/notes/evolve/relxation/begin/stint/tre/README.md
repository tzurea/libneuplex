In tension our {{c1::internal environment}} does not match our {{c2::pattern of existence}}  ~

As a rule of relaxation you should shut off all {{c1::conscious }} activity of the things you have {{c2::completed}} ~
Relaxation techniques take the consciousness away from emotionally {{c1::charged}} to emotionally {{c2::neutral}} activities ~
In deeper states of relaxation the detachment between {{c1::mind}} and {{c1::body}} occurs becuase sensory and {{c2::motor}} nerves cease to {{c3::function}} due to {{c4::muscle}} inactivity ~
Natural equanimity occurs when {{c1::higher}} brain centers do not hinder the activity of {{c2::lower}} brain centers due to the absence of worries, tension and other mental patterns  ~

In naukasana you should feel that every {{c1::muscle is tensed}}  ~
You should attempt to maintain the rasied position for {{c1::slow}} count of {{c2::10}} in naukasana   ~
You should relax for the count of {{c1::60}} in naukasana before another round ~

{{c1::Shavasana}} is also called {{c2::corpse pose}}  ~
{{c2::Mitrasana}} is also called {{c1::Shavasana}} ~
{{c1::Shavasana}} is systematic {{c2::relaxation }} by rotating the consioucness around varioud parts of the body with complete stillness ~
In shavasana palm should face {{c1::upwards}} and hand should not be {{c2::clenched}}  ~
The first feeling in shavasana should be of {{c1::contact}} between {{c2::floor}} and {{c2::buttocks}}  ~
The second feeling in shavasana should be of the contact between the {{c1::ground}} and {{c2::right}} {{c1::heel}} and the {{c3::left}} {{c3::hell}} for few seconds ~
The third feeling in shavasana should be contact between the floor and the {{c1::right arm}} {{c2::right hand}} {{c3::left arm}} {{c4::left hand}} {{c5::middle of the back}} {{c6::shoulder blades}} {{c7::back of the head}} and finally the whole {{c8::body}} by spending few seconds at each contact point	 ~
The fourth feeling in savasana is that of the {{c1::heaviness}} of {{c2::legs}} which are {{c3::sinking}} into the {{c4::floor}} followed by both {{c5::arms}} 	 ~
When thoughts occur in shavasana do not {{c1::supress}} but continue to direct the {{c2::attention}} towards the systsematic {{c2::relaxation}}  ~
On cold atmosphere or with insects you should cover yourself with {{c1::blanket}} in shavasana ~
